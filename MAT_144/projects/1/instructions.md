Greetings discrete math students,

I don't have the time tonight to create the dropbox for the first assignment. I will do that some time soon. However, here are the details of your first assignment. Please read this message VERY CAREFULLY. The following 5 problems were selected from your textbook.

Chapter 3 Computer Projects:

7.  Given two strings of characters, use the naive string matching algorithm to determine whether the shorter string occurs in the longer string.

8.  Given an integer n, use the Cashier's algorithm to find the change for n cents using quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

The following problem was taken from Section 4 of Chapter 4 of your textbook.

26. Find all solutions, if any, to the system of congruences x ≡ 5 (mod 6), x ≡ 3 (mod 10), and x ≡ 8 (mod 15).

The following two problems were taken from the Computer Projects section of Chapter 5.

9.  Given a list of integers and an element x, locate x in this list using a recursive implementation of linear search.

10. Given a list of integers and an element x, locate x in this list using a recursive implementation of a binary search.

DO NOT SUBMIT SOLUTIONS TO ALL FIVE PROBLEMS!!!! Pick one problem, and then solve the problem using either Wolfram Mathematica, Python or Racket. Please test your code to make sure it works! Remember to let me know which problem you're solving. And of course, your name must appear at the top of your source code, or at least make sure that your name is included in your file name. Otherwise, how can I possibly know whose assignment I am grading?

What is the due date? The due date is Friday, October 29th, before midnight. I WILL NOT ACCEPT LATE WORK NO MATTER WHAT THE EXCUSE IS. You have plenty of time to get this done. Please submit this to me via the dropbox. I have not created the drop box yet...but I will. Submit your work to me via the drop box. PICK ONLY ONE OF THE ASSIGNMENTS ABOVE! AND PICK ONLY ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AMONG THE FOLLOWING THREE: Wolfram Mathematica, Python, and Racket.

That's it for now.

Best,

Mr. Lewit
