# Function pointers
Pointers can point to functions!

 Functions are just instructions you give to the computer to do a task. Those instructions are then compiled down to binary and then stored at an address.

Function calls are `goto` commands, which tell control to go to an address and execute instructions.

The entry point of a function is the address of the first instruction of a function.

Function pointers store the starting address or entry point of the block of memory containing all the instructions of a function.
