Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing Probing, Collisions.

Please See 4 Example files in this sections. Also please see Topic3 Spring 2021 as Reference.

I will email  input file  for this assignment. Each student will get their individual file.

Input file will have sequence of numbers. 

As Exercise3 you will need to calculate collisions by hand and create docx file with description of the process of Linear probing,
 Quadratic Probing and Double Hasing Probing similar to Topic3ProbingCollisions_Example.docx with your input file.

Table has size 11 and Double Factor is 7.

As Lab3 you have to write program that do Linear probing, Quadratic Probing and Double Hasing Probing and calculate collisions, 
but already not by hand, but by program and take as input input file that I send you via email (and you use in Exercise3), 
your program must produce output file similar to Example_output_Collision_20210913.txt and Example_output_Probing_20210913.txt 
(Instead of files output can be to console)

Size of table may vary. Double factor may vary. 

You have to take input from file that I email to you,

Each student will get his/her own file.  All files are different.
